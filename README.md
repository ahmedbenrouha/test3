# test3
A hostname is composed of one or more parts separated by a dot, where every part contains one or more of the following characters: characters from ‘A’ to ‘Z’ (case insensitive), numbers, dashes (‘-’) and underlines (‘_’). Write a function f3 that accepts a string, a, as parameter and returns 0 if a is not a valid hostname and the number of parts it contains otherwise.
